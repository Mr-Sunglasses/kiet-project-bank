The proposed method decides for each trajectory point if the vessel is anomalous, considering longitude, latitude, speed and direction.It can detect anomalous navigational behaviors based on the mentioned parameters. The idea is to generate arbitrary shapes of moving patterns and stopping areas. If the anomaly ratio exceeds the threshold values the system will notify the authorities concerned and will also assist in navigating the ship back to the usual trajectory",

    description:"It is a web application itself written in PHP and can be used to test remote, or local, web applications for security vulnerabilities. As a scan is running, details of the scan are dynamically updated to the user. These details include the status of the scan, the number of URLs found on the web application, the number of vulnerabilities found and details of the vulnerabilities found.

In our web application the govt. officials, as well as the user, has to register themselves first. There are various features like legal assistant used for helping the user to understand the scheme, various opportunities launched by Govt. for women, complaint lodge for firing any complaint about anything which will be taken into consideration and map service for locating various district office, NGOs, CBOs etc. The govt. officials have the access to upload any new scheme or they can just mail the admin about the scheme so he can upload it on the website. For greater benefit of the user, we will also present a mobile app with a notification alert, if any new scheme or opportunity is uploaded. The GPS service in the mobile will help the user to track the NGOs and CBOs for their specific purposes.",
