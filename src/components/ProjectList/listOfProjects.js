This can be accomplished via a real-time location system (RTLS) if there are vehicles parked that need to be located quickly. But more commonly, an active RFID transponder is affixed to a vehicle, with readers set up at various points—at a mine’s entry gate, at a weigh station, at an exit and so forth. Software tracks the truck’s location, and you can usually run a variety of reports. The best solution really depends on the type of information that you would like to collect and use.",
